            Situated at an elevation of 1,454 metres along the banks of Gilgit
            River, a quaint little town of Gilgit has spectacular scenic beauty.
            For centuries, it had been the capital of various dynasties. Its
            history goes well beyond the 6th century AD. What to see? Gilgit
            Bridge is a bridge over the fast-flowing Gilgit River. This is one
            of the largest suspension bridges in South Asia (182 metres long and
            2 metres wide) allowing enough space for one jeep at a time to
            cross. A beautiful standing Buddha figure (locally known as
            «Yashini») is carved on a rock near KargahNullah), 10 km from Gilgit
            town. It dates back to the 7th century AD. Remains of a Buddhist
            monastery and stupas of the 6th century AD were discovered in 1938
            and 1956 near Nurpur. There are also ancient rock carvings of
            animals near the Karakorum University and inscriptions near Danyore.
            Built in 1962, Independence Monument is a tribute to the heroes of
            the liberation movement of 1947–48. A victory monument of Taj
            Mughal, built 700 years ago, as a reminder of Taj-ud-Din Mughal, a
            ruler who came to Gilgit Baltistan during the 13th century, AD, is
            30 km jeep drive from Gilgit town. Sher Qila (Lion’s Fort), situated
            38 km west of Gilgit, was once the capital of the ancient Kingdom of
            Punial. It has a polo ground, an old carved wooden mosque and a
            150-year-old watchtower, crowned with a pair of Ibex horns. Gahkuch
            Headquarters of Ghizer District is an ideal place for trekking,
            fishing and duck shooting. Yasin, the main town of the Yasin Valley,
            112 km west of Gilgit, is located at the altitude of 2,750 m above
            sea level. People of Yasin speak Brushisky and Khowar languages.
            Until the 20th century, Yasin was an important kingdom controlling
            the shortest and easiest route between the Oxus and the Indus
            rivers.
